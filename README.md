## NMEA 2000 ESP32 Integration for Home Assistant

![Smart Boat 2000 ESP Integration](.github/smart2000.png)

The **ha-smart2000esp** integration lets **Home Assistant** receive live **NMEA 2000 (CAN bus)** data over Wi-Fi using an ESP32 with a CAN transceiver. Place it near your N2K backbone and stream engine data, tank levels, wind, depth, GPS, and other marine instruments directly into your dashboards. Perfect for **Raspberry Pi**-based central marine computers and boat automation projects where running cables is difficult or you want a flexible, wireless solution.
